# Pods

A Pod is the smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes.

## Characteristics

- One or more containers
- Shared network namespace
- Shared storage volumes
- Scheduled on a single node

Pods are ephemeral by nature and are usually managed by higher-level controllers like Deployments or StatefulSets.
